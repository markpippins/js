      'Buy it if:\n' +
      "**✅ You want an OLED Chromebook:** An OLED display on a Chromebook is uncommon, so if that's what you're looking for, this is the best choice.\n" +
      "✅ **You need long battery life:** It's possible to squeeze 18-19 hours of battery life out of this Chromebook if you make the right adjustments in settings.\n" +
      '✅ **You want a more robust system than Android or iOS can offer:** As powerful as Android and iOS have become, mobile operating systems are still far more restricted than Windows, MacOS, or Linux OS.\n' +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      "❌ **You have more limited manual dexterity:** Some may find the Duet's smaller-than-standard keyboard a bit fiddly. If that's likely to be the case for you, a larger laptop such as the Acer Swift 3 ([skip to that entry](#6-acer-swift-3)) may be a better option.\n" +
      "**❌ You're on a tight budget:** The Duet 5 Chromebook is incredibly affordable for the premium features it offers, but it's not the best option out there for those on a tight budget.\n" +
      "❌ **You want a traditional laptop OS:** Chrome OS isn't as robust as Windows 10 or MacOS and it isn't meant to be. If you want a traditional laptop environment, a Chromebook will only get you part of the way there, which may not be enough to satisfy your needs.\n" +
      'The bottom line\n' +
      "💻 **The Lenovo IdeaPad Duet 5 Chromebook** offers good performance, a gorgeous display, and a new form factor –plus outstanding battery life – improving on its predecessor. It's a brilliant value for money. ★★★★½\n" +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      "The [Lenovo](https://www.techradar.com/tag/lenovo) IdeaPad Duet Chromebook 5 is the best ultra-low price laptop you can buy, and it's a brilliant follow-up to the original IdeaPad Duet. While it’s been out for a while, Chromebooks don’t date as quickly as Windows laptops, and it's still one of the [best Chromebooks](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-chromebook) we've used. If you're a Chromebook skeptic, the IdeaPad Duet Chromebook just might convert you. It can be used as both a laptop and a tablet thanks to its detachable keyboard, while also boasting an impressively long battery life. You're simply not going to find a Windows 11 laptop that can outlast the 20-hour battery life the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook offers – especially at this price. It’s a particularly good choice for students who want something reliable, flexible and affordable.\n" +
      "**Design:** The Duet 5 Chromebook's keyboard is [Ultrabook](https://www.techradar.com/tag/ultrabook)\\-worthy in quality and comfort, and it can be easily detached, turning the Duet 5 into a tablet-like device. Meanwhile, the magnetized backplate on the Duet 5 Chromebook has a small clip to house a Lenovo Active Pen stylus, even though the stylus isn't included in the box. The best thing about the design, however, is the gorgeous 1080p [OLED](https://www.techradar.com/tag/oled) display, which offers exceptional image quality - especially considering the price.\n" +
      '**Performance:** When it comes to general web browsing, video streaming, and basic productivity use, the Duet 5 does exactly what you want it to do without so much as a hiccup. Its CPU is upgraded to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c Gen2 processor, which is a step up from the last model, and the 8GB of RAM is a decent amount for a Chromebook, keeping things running very smoothly.\n' +
      '**Battery life:** While Chromebooks on average get about 10 hours of life on a fully-charged battery, the Lenovo Duet 5 lasted a huge 16 hours. This is a drop from the previous model (which managed over 20 hours), which is disappointing.\n' +
      "**Value for money:** As far as Chromebooks and 2-in-1 laptops go, this is hands down the best value you're going to find in a portable device of its kind. When it launched, it was more expensive than its predecessor, but over time, its price has dropped, making it superb value for money.\n" +

      '✅ **You want a cheap laptop:** The Acer Aspire 5 is a no-frills laptop that does the job well for a lot less than other Windows 11 laptops.\n' +
      "✅ **You want a very portable laptop:** This budget laptop is impressively light without feeling cheep and tacky, and that means it's comfortable to carry around with you throughout the day.\n" +
      "✅ **You don't want a Chromebook:** There are cheaper Chromebooks out there, but due to the limitations of ChromeOS, they aren't for everyone. The Acer Aspire 5 is cheap, but also runs Windows 11.\n" +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      "❌ **You want a gaming laptop:** The Acer Aspire can be configured with a discrete GPU, but that ups the price, and still doesn't turn it into a gaming laptop.\n" +
      "❌ **You want long battery life:** At around six and a half hours, the battery life isn't awful, but nor is it exceptional. The [Lenovo IdeaPad Duet](#section-the-best-chromebook), above, offers much better battery life.\n" +
      'The bottom line\n' +
      '💻 **The Acer Aspire 5** is a brilliant budget laptop that is comfortable to carry around, but is also sturdily built. Windows 11 runs well on it, and as you can configure it with a graphics card, it does a decent job at video editing for the price. ★★★★\n' +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      "As long as you keep your expectations in check, the [Acer](https://www.techradar.com/tag/acer) Aspire 5 remains the [best cheap laptop](https://www.techradar.com/best/the-best-cheap-laptop) you can buy in 2024\\. Its design is lightweight yet doesn't feel cheap, its large screen size is comfortable to work on, and you can even configure it to come with an Nvidia GPU. Don't mistake this for a gaming laptop however. But, the GPU can help make the Aspire 5 punch above its weight when it comes to video editing. For the price, you'll pleasantly surprised.\n" +
      "**Design:** The Acer Aspire 5 won't win any design or innovation awards, but it offers you a solid, dependable laptop design that will at least feel familiar. Weighing 1.7kg and measuring 18mm thick, it's a laptop you can easily carry around with you. We didn't love the L-shaped power connector in our review, however, which sticks out a bit when plugged in.\n" +
      "**Performance:** The Acer Aspire 5 doesn't wow when it comes to performance - but nor does it disappoint. This is a solid and dependable laptop that you can rely on for your day-to-day needs. However, gaming is out of the question with the base model, which comes with integrated graphics. However, you can buy a model with a dedicated GPU, and this offers improved graphical performance - but don't expect to play demanding games on this thing.\n" +
      "**Battery life:** In our review we found the Acer Aspire 5 lasted around six and a half hours on battery. While this isn't awful, there are cheap laptops out there, especially Chromebooks, which offer much longer battery life. So, you'll likely want to bring its charging cable with you when you're out and about.\n" +
      '**Value for money:** As you might expect from a laptop we consider to be the best budget device money can buy, the Acer Aspire 5 offers excellent value for money, going for around $600 in the US and £500 in the UK. Even at that low price you get good performance, a nice design and 1080p screen.\n' +

      '**✅ You want a powerful laptop for school or university:** With the launch of the M3 MacBook Air ([also in this list](#section-the-best-laptop-overall)), the M2 model has had a major price cut - and students can get a further cut, making it a brilliant laptop for school.\n' +
      "**✅ You're thinking about getting the 13-inch MacBook Pro:** Because it's thinner, lighter, and cheaper, the MacBook Air (M2, 2022) is a better choice. Factor in its similar performance, and you've got a winner.\n" +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      "❌ **You are on a budget:** The MacBook Air (M2) is now the cheapest MacBook model, but if it's still too much, consider a Chromebook instead.\n" +
      '**❌ You want a lot of ports:** The MacBook Air (M2) comes with only two Thunderbolt ports. If you need more ports, consider the [MacBook Pro 16-inch below](#section-the-best-productivity-laptop) instead.\n' +
      "❌ **You need a bigger display:** To some folks, a 13-inch screen isn't enough. Luckily, you can always go for the [15-inch MacBook Air](https://www.techradar.com/computing/macbooks/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-m3).\n" +
      'The bottom line\n' +
      '💻 **The MacBook Air (M2, 2022)** boasts a design alongside a larger display and an impressive battery life of 16 hours. Its new lower price (plus further discounts for students) makes it an ideal laptop for studying and working on. ★★★★**½**\n' +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      "The Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M2) is in our opinion the best laptop for students you can buy right now. Thanks to a stylish design that makes this thin and light laptop feel more modern than previous models, this is a MacBook you can take almost anywhere. Not only is it portable, in our review we found that it offers a very decent 16-hour battery life, and the screen is a joy to work on. Now that a newer model has been release, the M2 MacBook Air has had a big price cut - and you can get a further $100/£100 knocked off if you are a student. This makes it a brilliant laptop for school and university use - it'll easily last your entire course.\n" +
      '**Design:** After years of sticking to a safe tried-and-tested design, Apple finally gave the MacBook Air a much-needed makeover with this model. It’s thinner and lighter than before, making it more portable, and by slimming down the bezels around the screen, it’s allowed Apple to include a larger display without making it bulky. The screen is bright and vibrant, and the new modern look and new color options makes the MacBook Air (M2) one of the best looking laptops you can buy, even a few years after its launch.\n' +
      '**Performance:** During our time reviewing the MacBook Air, it delivered incredible performance across the board. It quickly boots into macOS, and apps run smoothly (and look fantastic on the new display). We found even when browsing the web in both Safari and Chrome with lots of tabs open, the MacBook Air (M2) kept up, though we may soon find the 8GB of memory that comes with the base model a bit too limited. Meanwhile, thanks to the redesigned keyboard, whipping up documents and composing emails feel effortless and comfortable.\n' +
      "**Battery life:** In our tests, the MacBook Air 13-inch (M2) lasted a huge 16 hours on battery while playing a 1080p video – that's a 30-minute improvement over the [MacBook Pro 13-inch (M2, 2022)](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-m2-2022), and five hours longer than the [MacBook Air (M1, 2020)](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-macbook-air-m12020). This laptop will last you throughout an entire workday or on a long-haul flight, and then some. It's not the longest life you'll find in a MacBook - the new MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Max) almost hits 24 hours on a single charge.\n" +
      "**Value for money:** The MacBook Air launched at $1,199 / £1,249 / AU$1,899, a substantial leap from the older MacBook Air’s launch price. However, with the launch of the M3 MacBook Air, the 13-inch MacBook Air (M2) is now officially on sale for $999 / $999 / AU$1,599 - making it much better value for money, and arguably selling for the price it should have launched at. Even better, if you're a student with an appropriate ID, you can get it for $899 / £899 / AU$1,439\\. For that price you're not going to get a better laptop.\n" +

      '**✅ You want the best Windows 11 laptop:** The solid, stylish and lightweight design, excellent performance and stunning screen makes the Dell XPS 13 Plus the best Windows 11 laptop out there.\n' +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      "❌ **You want a cheap laptop:** Dell's XPS lineup are premium laptops, and the XPS 13 Plus is no different. This is a cutting-edge Ultrabook with a price to match.\n" +
      "**❌ You hate using adapters:** The Dell XPS 13 Plus doesn't have a lot of ports, so you'll need an adapter or hub to fully make use of this laptop.\n" +
      '❌ **You want long battery life:** While the Dell XPS 13 Plus is a brilliant Windows 11 device, its battery life is disappointing, especially compared to the MacBook Air 13-inch (M3) [at the top of this page](#section-the-best-laptop-overall).\n' +
      'The bottom line\n' +
      '💻 **The Dell XPS 13 Plus** is yet another brilliant Ultrabook from Dell, and is easily the best Windows 11 laptop you can buy right now. It offers new and improved components for even better performance, and can be configured with up to 32GB of RAM, making it great for power users as well. However, battery life is disappointing compared to the previous model. ★★★★☆\n' +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      "The Dell XPS 13 Plus is a premium version of the Dell XPS 13 - a thin and light laptop which was often featured at the very top of this best laptops buying guide. While Apple's reinvigorated MacBook Airs have knocked Dell's offerings from the top spot, the current Dell XPS 13 Plus remains the best Windows 11 laptop money can buy. With a gorgeous thin and light design and stunning OLED screen, plus some of the latest mobile components from [Intel](https://www.techradar.com/tag/intel), this is a laptop that gives the new MacBook Air 13-inch (M3) a run for its money in most departments - except battery life. Still, it's a great alternative if you want to use Windows 11 rather than macOS.\n" +
      "**Design:** The Dell XPS 13 Plus features the same design as the previous model, but that's no bad thing - this remains one of the best looking laptops around. Ultra-thin bezels surround the screen, and the silver body, invisible touchpad and touch bar above the keyboard all lead to this laptop feeling impressively premium. The thin and light design does mean there's a lack of ports, however, so you may need to use an adapter.\n" +
      '**Performance:** The Dell XPS 13 Plus that we reviewed comes with a cutting-edge Intel Core i7-1360P processor, and 32GB of RAM, which led to us being extremely impressed by its performance. The integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics do a good job for day-to-day creative tasks, though you may want a laptop with a discrete GPU for more intensive workloads.\n' +
      "**Battery life:** In our battery life benchmark, we found the XPS 13 Plus lasted six hours and 20 minutes. These days, we'd expect most modern laptops (apart from gaming laptops) to last around 10 hours at least, so this is certainly disappointing. With a few tweaks, it'll get you through a workday, but we wouldn't want to go too far without a charger.\n" +
      "**Value for money:** Starting at $1,249 / £1,198.99 / AU$2,398, this is not a cheap laptop, but nor is it outrageously priced, especially when you compare it to the base model of the MacBook Air 13-inch (M3). The Dell XPS 13 Plus base model comed with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD storage, both twice the amount that the base MacBook Air comes with. For the specs and performance you get, you'll be very happy if you can afford it - and keep an eye out around Black Friday, as Dell often has some of the best price cuts around.\n" +

      'The bottom line\n' +
      "💻 The **Acer Chromebook Plus 515** proves that you don't have to spend a lot of money if you want a great laptop for working from home. Great performance, a large screen, and low price make this a great choice for home workers. ★★★★☆\n" +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      "If you have found yourself working from home more and need a new laptop, then don't think you have to spend a fortune. While a new MacBook will do everything you need, a great Chromebook like the Acer Chromebook Plus 515 can cope with most day-to-day workloads for a fraction of the price. You get a large screen and comfortable keyboard to work on, and performance is snappy - especially when you boot up the Chromebook.\n" +
      "**Design:** The design of the Acer Chromebook Plus 515 is pretty straightforward, with a gray body and Google logo, and while that might not make it the most interesting of laptops, it's solidly built and dependable. The 15-inch screen makes it comfortable to work on, though it also means the overall size of the laptop is quite large.\n" +
      "**Performance:** As far as Chromebooks go, the Acer Chromebook Plus 515 is an excellent performer, with the Chrome OS operating system booting quickly, while apps run impressively smoothly. It feels fast and responsive - something you wouldn't be able to say about many Windows 11 laptops of this price. For day-to-day tasks, including document creation, emails and video calls, the Acer Chromebook Plus 515 performs very well - though you are limited to apps built for Chrome OS or Android.\n" +
      "**Battery life:** Usually the battery lives of Chromebooks are one of their main selling points, but in our tests, the Acer Chromebook Plus 515 only lasted a disappointing five hours and 13 minutes. While that's not ridiculously low, it is surprisingly short for a Chromebook, which is a shame.\n" +
      "**Value for money:** The Acer Chromebook Plus 515 offers exceptional value for money. Selling for $399.99 / £399.99, it's an affordable laptop that punches well above its weight. While we recommend it for working from home, it's also a great choice for students or anyone who wants a budget laptop but doesn't want to make compromises on performance.\n" +

      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      "❌ **You have an earlier 16-inch MacBook Pro:** The M3 Pro and M3 Max 16-inch MacBook Pro models are the second to have launched last year, so if you have the M2 Pro or M2 Max models, don't worry - they are still very good.\n" +
      "**❌ You’re looking for an affordable workstation laptop:** The 16-inch MacBook Pro is an expensive investment, which means it may be priced out of many people's reach. The [14-inch model](https://www.techradar.com/computing/macbooks/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-m3-max-2023-review) is more affordable, and you can get it with the base M3 chip.\n" +
      '❌ **You’re a casual user:** Unless you’re a creative professional, you’re unlikely to need the kind of performance that the MacBook Pro 16-inch offers, especially with the M3 Max chip. For regular use, the MacBook Air 15-inch ([also in this guide](#section-the-best-15-inch-laptop)) will be a better buy.\n' +
      'The bottom line\n' +
      "💻 The **MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Pro/M3 Max)** is Apple's latest instalment in its high-end prosumer laptop range. Despite launching less than a year after the previous model, thanks to a choice of new M3 Pro or M3 Max chips, and up to 128GB unified memory, it's had a hefty upgrade, and while M2 Pro/M2 Max MacBook Pro owners shouldn't need to upgrade, if you want the best laptop for productivity, then this is it ★★★★★\n" +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      "The MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Pro/M3 Max) is hands-down the best laptop for creative professionals we’ve ever tested – even though it comes just nine months after the last model. It's powered by the new M3 Pro and M3 Max SoCs, Apple's most powerful chips. There wasn’t a task it couldn’t handle during our testing. It did an impressive job of handling 4K video editing, even with multiple 4K and 8K video files, as well as running the latest and most demanding games. Along with the [new MacBook Pro 14-inch](https://www.techradar.com/computing/macbooks/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-m3-max-2023-review), this may be the very first MacBook for gaming.\n" +
      "**Design:** Design-wise, the MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Pro/M3 Max) doesn't deviate from its predecessor. There is, however, a new color option, called Space Black, that's apparently made with a material with an anodization seal that's designed to minimizes fingerprint retention, helping you maintain a clean laptop.\n" +
      "**Performance:** Our independent benchmark tests showed a hefty leap in performance between the M3 Max and M1 Max MacBook Pro 16-inches. We saw a good 35% increase in single core and a considerable 69% increase in multi-core CPU performance in Geekbench 6\\. You should, therefore, see a noticeable time reduction when completing workloads, specifically graphics-intensive ones. The MacBook Pro 16-inch M3 Max's performance makes workloads fast, fluid and incredibly seamless, especially for creatives.\n" +
      `**Battery life:** Apple promises up to 22 hours of video playback, and 15 hours of web browsing on a single charge for the MacBook Pro 16-inch, with what it says is the "longest battery life ever in a Mac". The good news is that those claims are pretty spot on, as we found that in our battery life benchmark test, where we ran a looped 1080p video until the MacBook Pro turned off, the battery lasted over 24 hours. Considering the power on offer here, that's extremely impressive.\n` +
      "**Value for money:** The MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Pro/M3 Max) is an incredibly ambitious laptop both in terms of hardware and design, and it’s aimed at creative professionals who need powerful mobile hardware. Yes, it's an expensive laptop - but if you need all that power, it's well worth paying for it.\n" +

      "✅ **You want something to work on while travelling:** This laptop is incredibly thin, despite having two screens, and it doesn't weigh much either. This makes it a great laptop to take with you while travelling.\n" +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      "❌ **You're on a tight budget:** The Lenovo Yoga Book 9i’s unique design and powerful components come at a cost - a big cost. You may be better off going for something more affordable.\n" +
      "**❌ You don’t need two displays:** The main selling point of the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i is its dual-screen display. If you're not going to use that, go for a cheaper 2-in-1 laptop that offers similar flexibility.\n" +
      '❌ **You want something less flashy:** The unique design of the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i certainly gets a lot of attention - but that may be something not everyone wants, especially in public places, or during work meetings.\n' +
      'The bottom line\n' +
      '💻 The **Lenovo Yoga Book 9i** is incredibly elegant, and it’s just as capable, whether you’re doing general productivity work or editing a batch of high-resolution images in Lightroom. Its screens are gorgeous as well. Finally, this is a dual-screen laptop done right. Beware of that steep price tag, however. ★★★★½\n' +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      'One of the [best touchscreen laptops](https://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/roundup/10-best-touchscreen-laptops-in-the-world-909937) – and naturally, among the [best 2-in-1 laptops](https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-2-in-1-laptops-top-5-hybrid-laptops-reviewed-1258451) – we’ve tested in 2023 (so far), the Yoga Book 9i is an incredible dual-screen laptop that actually uses the second screen well. The Yoga Book 9i sees you through your productivity and multitasking in a seamless and time-saving way without the extra weight. It’s also a capable piece of kit with cutting-edge mobile components powering it - but it also comes with a very high price.\n' +
      "**Design:** We completely fell in love with the Yoga Book 9i when we reviewed it. The dual-screen design works brilliantly, and it's one of the few dual-screen laptops that doesn't feel like a gimmick. Instead, it can really help your productivity - either by giving you more space to work on (like a multi-monitor setup on a desk would), and by allowing you to work on it in several modes, so you can choose the most useful and comfortable mode depending on what you're working on.\n" +
      "**Performance:** The Intel Core i7-1355U processor of the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i offers an excellent balance between strong day-to-day performance and efficiency. Efficiency is especially important for thin and light laptops like the Yoga Book 9i, as it means they don't so easily overheat when being used - a worry for some thin laptops due to lack of space in the body for air to circulate. The OLED screens also look brilliant.\n" +
      "**Battery life:** The efficient processor doesn't just keep the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i cool, it also means that despite having two OLED screens, battery life isn't too bad at all. In our review, we found that it lasted almost nine and a half hours during our battery life tests, and if you turn off one screen, that jumps up to just over 12 hours.\n" +
      "**Value for money:** Let's be blunt: this is an expensive laptop, with a launch price of $1,999 / £2,299.99 / AU$4,299, and it's unlikely to drop in price any time soon. Its dual screens and premium design does mean the high price is understandable, but there's no escaping the fact that its price could put a lot of people off.\n" +

      'Buy it if\n' +
      "✅ **You want a lightweight gaming laptop:** We're not talking about performance, but the actual build and design of the Razer Blade 14 is seriously svelte.\n" +
      '✅ **You want epic performance:** As for performance, Razer has kitted this out with some of the best mobile tech around - and it shows.\n' +
      "✅ **Audio quality is important:** The dual speaker setup leads to some of the best audio we've heard from built-in speakers.\n" +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      "❌ **You’re on a budget:** Razer laptops are notoriously expensive, and the Razer Blade 14 is no exception. [Check out the HP Victus 15 instead](#section-the-best-affordable-gaming-laptop), which we've picked as the best cheap laptop you can buy right now.\n" +
      "❌ **You want long battery life:** As you might expect from a powerful gaming laptop, the battery doesn't last long.\n" +
      '❌ **You want to travel really light:** While thin compared to most gaming laptops, the Razer Blade 14 has a chunky power brick. Yes, you can use USB-C instead, but it won’t supply enough power to keep up when gaming.\n' +
      'The bottom line\n' +
      "💻 The **Razer Blade 14 (2023)** is the company's best gaming laptop yet. Sporting a thin and light chassis, as well as cutting-edge specs, it doesn’t compromise on performance. However, battery life isn't the best. ★★★★½\n" +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      "This year’s Razer Blade 14 refresh has been outfitted with the latest specs, including the AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS CPU, which sports a 5.2 GHz max clock speed and eight cores/16 threads, and up to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU. Despite coming with high-end components, it's a stunningly thin and light laptop - something most gaming laptops just cannot offer.\n" +
      "**Design:** Razer makes some of the [best thin and light laptops](https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-ultrabook-18-top-thin-and-lights-1054355) on the market, including the Razer Blade 14 (2023). Razer has done a great job of including high-end specs like the Nvidia RTX 4070 graphics card, while keeping the overall weight and thickness down - it weighs just four pounds, and with the 14-inch screen, the Razer Blade 14 proves that gaming laptops don't have to be big and bulky.\n" +
      "**Performance:** The Razor Blade 14 (2023) offers superb performance when gaming, allowing you to play even the most demanding games, such as _Cyberpunk 2077_ at their highest settings, while maintaining high frame rates. The 14-inch screen comes with a high 240Hz refresh, and that combined with the RTX 4070 GPU ensures your games feel fast and responsive. We really can't fault the performance of the Razer Blade 14 in any way.\n" +
      "**Battery life:** According to Razer, the Razer Blade 14 (2023) should offer up to 10 hours of battery life, but in our review, we found it was more like eight hours when using it for day-to-day work. When you start playing games on it, the battery struggles to make it past four hours - so you'll want to have this plugged in.\n" +
      "**Value for money:** Razer's reputation for expensive laptops is well deserved here. Despite it being a 14-inch laptop, its starting price point of $2,399 / £2,499.99 / AU$4,499 will be far too high for many people, though remember this is a gaming laptop with some of the best components you can currently buy.\n" +

      "**✅ You want a solid and attractive 17-inch laptop:** The Dell XPS 17 (9730) features the premium design and build quality we've come to expect from Dell's XPS lineup, alongside a large 17-inch screen.\n" +
      '**✅ You want excellent performance:** The XPS 17 comes with very powerful components that means it performs brilliantly no matter what you throw at it.\n' +
      '**✅ You want a laptop that lasts:** Despite its large screen and powerful components, battery life of the Dell XPS 17 impresses, with almost 10 hours on a single charge.\n' +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      '❌ **You want a gaming laptop:** The Dell XPS 17 can be configured to come with a dedicated GPU, but this is not a gaming laptop. Serious gamers can get better performance with the Razer Blade 14 ([click for details](#9-razer-blade-14)).\n' +
      "**❌ You want a budget laptop:** The Dell XPS 17 is a large, flagship laptop with a premium design, which means it's quite expensive compared to other laptops - even big screen ones.\n" +
      "❌ **Portability is a must:** Unsurprisingly, this 17-inch laptop isn't the easiest to carry around compared to 13-inch Ultrabooks. That said, for the size, it is impressively svelte.\n" +
      'The bottom line\n' +
      "💻 **The Dell XPS 17 (9730)** is another great example that you don't have to sacrifice portability or design if you want a laptop with a large screen. This is thin, elegant and powerful ★★★★½\n" +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      "The Dell XPS 17 (9730) remains the best large-screen laptop you can buy. If you find that working on a 13-inch or even 15-inch laptop isn't comfortable, then this is a laptop that's well worth considering. One of the best things about the Dell XPS 17 is that as well as offering an excellent large screen to work on, it maintains the thin, light and stylish design of the smaller XPS 13 and XPS 15 models, so you're not making too many compromises to portability for the bigger display. As a flagship laptop, the Dell XPS 17 comes with some of the most powerful mobile components around, including a discrete graphics card from Nvidia's latest RTX 4000 series, and while it can play game, it's best used as a productivity laptop. Digital creatives will especially love its mix of large screen and powerful components.\n" +
      "**Design:** The Dell XPS 17 looks and feels extremely premium thanks to its machined aluminum body. Thin bezels surround the display, giving it a modern look while also keeping the overall size of the laptop as compact as possible. This isn't a laptop you can comfortably carry around in a small bag, mind you, but Dell has done a great job of making sure it's not big or bulky.\n" +
      "**Performance:** This is an excellent performer, packed with high-end components from Intel and Nvidia. Day to day tasks feel fast and responsive, and heavy creative workloads, such as 3D rendering and 4K video editing, are handled well. If you want a powerful workstation laptop with a large screen for creative work, and you don't fancy the MacBook Pro 16-inch ([which is also in this guide](#section-the-best-productivity-laptop)), then this is an excellent alternative.\n" +
      "**Battery life:** Powerful laptops with large screens often suffer from poor battery life, but thanks to the efficient hardware in the Dell XPS 17, it avoids that fate. During our review, we found that for watching videos and web browsing, it'll last just under 10 hours on a single charge, meaning you can use it unplugged for a whole workday - though heavier workloads will see the battery deplete faster.\n" +
      '**Value for money:** The Dell XPS 17 (9730) starts at $1,599 / £2,698.99 / AU$4,398.90, though the base model varies depending on location. This is certainly pricey for a laptop, though you do get good specs, a large screen and thin and light design for your money. If you configure it with more powerful components, expect the price to rise even further.\n' +

      '**✅ You need a long-lasting laptop:** The MacBook Air M3 lasted more than 15 hours in our battery test, which is longer than its predecessors. This laptop can last you all day and more.\n' +
      "**✅ You want a small, fast MacBook:** The M3 chip inside this MacBook Air gives it more than enough power for multitasking, and it pairs well with the long battery life and light weight. While it can't crunch video or play games as well as the MacBook Pros with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, this is the ultimate MacBook for getting things done on the go.\n" +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      "**❌ You want to play games:** While this laptop does a stellar job of running games optimized for Apple silicon, non-supported games have trouble running at acceptable frame rates. There's also the lack of developer support. If games are important to you, consider looking elsewhere.\n" +
      "❌ **You own a MacBook Air 13-inch M2:** The MacBook Air M3 is certainly powerful, completely outclassing its M1 counterpart. However, if you own an Air M2, you don't need its M3 variant since the performance difference between the two is minimal.\n" +
      'The bottom line\n' +
      '💻 **The MacBook Air M3** is a bit pricey, but it justifies the premium with an unbeatable combination of performance, battery life, display quality and portability.\n' +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      "The MacBook Air M3 is an excellent all-rounder that feels truly worthy of the Air name. Though it's virtually indistinguishable from the excellent [MacBook Air 13-inch M2](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/macbook-air-2022-m2) that previously topped this list, the M3 variant is hard to dismiss.\n" +
      "The MacBook Air M3 (from $1,099) is a breath of fresh you-know-what, and that’s because Apple paired that speedy M3 chip with the same ultraportable design of its predecessor. It's a potent blend of performance and portability, one we recommend as one of the best laptops for getting work done on the go for most folks.\n" +
      '**Design:** The MacBook Air M3 is so thin it could easily be mistaken for an [iPad](https://www.tomsguide.com/tag/ipad) when closed (especially if the Apple logo is facing out). That’s how slim this notebook is. Measuring just 0.44 inches thick with the lid open, an everyday Bic pen looks chunky next to this machine.\n' +
      "Don't expect to get much in the way of ports, however. As before, you get just a pair of Thunderbolt 4/USB 4 ports along the left edge, alongside a MagSafe power adapter. At least you also get a headphone jack.\n" +
      "**Display:** The 13.6-inch display offers a 2,560 x 1,664-pixel resolution and gets nice and bright in person, so it's a pleasant place to watch videos, write emails, edit photos and whatever else you want to do.\n" +
      'The MacBook Air M3 did well in our display tests, too. When we tested it with our light meter we found it delivers an average brightness of 476 nits, peaking around 496 when viewing HDR videos. That’s brighter than the [Dell XPS 13 OLED](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/dell-xps-13-oled-review)’s 357-nit average.\n' +
      '**Performance:** On Geekbench 6, which measures overall performance, the MacBook Air M2 hit 3,082 on the single-core CPU test and 12,087 on multi-core.',

      '**✅ You want a great Windows laptop:** There are many great Windows laptops out there, but the Dell XPS 15 shines with its winning combo of great design, performance and portability.\n' +
      '**✅You want a great display:** While the base XPS 15 is a solid laptop, adding the 3.5K OLED display upgrade really helps it shine. With bright lights, inky blacks and sharp contrasts, the XPS 15 OLED is easy on the eyes.\n' +
      "**✅ You want to play games:** It's not technically a gaming laptop, but you can pay to upgrade the XPS 15 with an Nvidia laptop GPU that makes it a pretty decent gaming machine.

      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      "**❌ Battery life is critical:** The Dell XPS 15's roughly 9-hour battery life isn't terrible, but you could do a lot better if that's what matters to you.\n" +

      'The bottom line\n' +
      "💻 **The Dell XPS 15** is an excellent Windows laptop that's perfect for work and playing graphically-intensive games. It's the full package, especially if you upgrade it with an OLED display and a discrete Nvidia graphics card for gaming/video work.\n" +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      'The Dell XPS 15 hits a sweet spot between portability, price and performance in a Windows laptop.\n' +
      "The 15-inch display lands almost right in the middle of the usual 13-inch to 18-inch screens we see on laptops. And while it's not as light as some ultraportables or as powerful as some gaming laptops, the XPS 15 is an excellent all-purpose Windows notebook that can be equipped with some pretty powerful components, if you're willing to pay for a top-tier model.\n" +
      "Though it does get pricey if you want the best model (the OLED display upgrade is especially worth getting if you can afford it, since it makes everything you do on the laptop look nicer), the XPS 15's great design and versatility make it one of the [best Windows laptops](https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/the-best-windows-laptops) you can buy.\n" +
      "**Design:** At 13.6 x 9.1 x 0.73 inches and roughly 4.2 pounds heavy, the Dell XPS 15 is pretty portable but still a bit heavier than laptops which prioritize thin-and-light designs. You can throw it in your backpack and carry it through a day of school or work, but you'll feel it in your shoulders by the end.\n" +
      '**Display:** The 15.6-inch display on the XPS 15 looks great and almost appears to hover in the the air thanks to the thin bezels of its InfinityEdge display. The big, beautiful screen is great for getting work done or watching movies, especially if you pay for the 3.5K OLED display upgrade.\n' +
      '**Performance:** The Dell XPS 15 is a capable machine, especially if you kit it out with the latest components. Our review unit was more than speedy enough at time of review thanks to its Intel CPU, 16GB of RAM and 512GB SSD.\n' +
      'Pay extra to cram some more RAM and a discrete Nvidia laptop graphics card in there and this all-purpose ultraportable becomes a decent gaming laptop, to boot.\n' +
      '**Battery life:** Our Dell XPS 15 review unit lasted just over 10 hours in our battery tests, which is good but not great when you consider that many MacBooks last 12-15 hours in the same tests.\n' +
      "However, it is much better than many Windows laptops, including the preceding XPS 15 (2021), which couldn't even last 8 hours in the same test. The newer XPS 15 also beat out both Windows ultraportables like the the [Lenovo Yoga 9i Gen 7](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/lenovo-yoga-9i-gen-7-review) (8:06) and gaming laptops like the [Alienware](https://www.tomsguide.com/tag/alienware) x14 (5:35).\n" +

While OLED displays are becoming more common in laptops and getting cheaper and cheaper, it's still rare to find one this good for this cheap.\n" +
      "**✅ Battery life matters:** The Asus Zenbook 13 OLED is one of the longest-lasting laptops we've tested, thanks in part to its power-sipping AMD CPU. While the latest CPUs from Apple and Intel are helping laptops last longer and longer, the Asus Zenbook 13 OLED remains a great choice if you want a lightweight, long-lasting Windows laptop.\n" +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      '**❌ You want a headphone jack:** While Bluetooth headphones exist, those of us who prefer an old-fashioned physical 3.5mm audio jack are out of luck with the Asus Zenbook 13 OLED.\n' +
      'The bottom line\n' +
      "💻 **The Asus Zenbook 13 OLED** is a winning combo of price and performance. It's a zippy little ultraportable with a gorgeous display and oodles of battery life, and it can be yours for cheaper than most premium Windows laptops.\n" +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      'The Asus Zenbook 13 OLED remains one of the best values in Windows laptops despite its age, delivering good performance, great battery life and a beautiful OLED screen for under a grand.\n' +
      "Of course, you have to make some trade-offs along the way. The keyboard is unsatisfying, there's no headphone jack and the webcam sucks. But if you can live with those compromises you get a lot of laptop for not a lot of money with the Asus Zenbook 13 OLED. Of course, that's assuming you can find one — we've kept this laptop on this list for years because it's such a great deal, but it's been superseded by newer, more expensive models that deliver less value, like the [Asus Zenbook S 13 OLED](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/asus-zenbook-s-13-oled-review).\n" +
      '**Design:** The Asus Zenbook 13 OLED looks good on a desk and is easy to carry, measuring 11.98 x 7.99 x 0.55 inches and weighing just over 2.5 pounds.\n' +
      "There's a spun-metal finish sporting an offset Asus logo on the lid, and inside you'll find subdued black plastic hues. Along the sides of this slim ultraportable you'll find a decent port array, including USB-C and USB-A ports, a microSD card reader and an HDMI out. The lack of a headphone jack hurts, but the laptop comes with a USB-C adapter if you want to plug some in.\n" +
      "**Display:** One of the biggest selling points of this laptop is its 13.3-inch 1080p OLED display, which looks lovely and vibrant in person. OLED displays often appear to display brighter brights, darker blacks and deeper contrasts between light and shadow than traditional IPS panels, and it's rare to get one this good on a laptop that costs under $1k.\n" +
      "But you should be aware that this laptop is difficult to use outside in direct sunlight, as it doesn't get terribly bright and the reflections make it hard to see what you're doing. If you're chiefly planning to use it indoors, then there's nothing to worry about.\n" +
      "**Performance:** The AMD CPU powering our Zenbook 13 review unit proved more than capable enough to tackle daily computing tasks without issue. It also managed to do so while only sipping battery power, which you'll notice when you look down at your battery testing charts.\n" +
      "Note that since there's no laptop GPU onboard and only 8GB of RAM this plucky little laptop is a pretty poor gaming machine, but it's but it's plenty good enough for work and simple games.\n" +
      "**Battery life:** The OLED-equipped Asus Zenbook 13 lasted roughly 15 hours in our battery test, which is incredible for a Windows laptop. It rivals the [best MacBooks](https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-macbook) in that regard, and even lasted longer than Asus' advertised 13 hours.\n" +
      "That's excellent battery life, and it should help you feel more assured about leaving the house without a charger when you take your laptop on the go.\n" +

      "💻 **The Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3** is a remarkably versatile and well-made Chrome 2-in-1 for not much money. While it has some issues, including an uncomfortable keyboard and no headphone jack, we feel it's the best Chromebook for most people.\n" +

      'The fact that the Duet 3 doubles as both a tablet and a laptop gives it remarkable versatility for the price, but you should know that detachable keyboards are not as comfortable to type on as a traditional clamshell laptop keyboard. So if you plan to do a lot of writing on your Chromebook, you might be happier with another of the [best Chromebooks](https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-chromebooks) on the market.\n' +
      'But if you like the idea of a Chrome tablet that you can type on when you want to knock out an email or a social post, the Duet 3 delivers great value in a slim package.\n' +
      "**Design:** The Duet 3 sports a luminous 11-inch 2K (2,000 x 1,200 pixels) screen housed in a black aluminum chassis that, at 10.16 x 6.48 x 0.31 inches and just 1.14 pounds, isn't hard to hold. Sure, the Duet 3 isn't quite as thin or light as pricier tablets like the base [iPad 2021](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/ipad-2021) (0.29 inches, 1.09 pounds), but it's awful close and feels plenty light enough to carry around the house all day.\n" +
      "**Display:** The Duet 3's 11-inch 2K display on the Duet 3 gets nice and bright, with good color accuracy. It's plenty responsive too, which you want in a touchscreen.\n" +
      'It gets a bit reflective in direct sunlight, but remains plenty usable for most applications.\n' +
      '**Performance:** Our Duet 3 review unit is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 chip, and it feels plenty snappy for basic work. In my own day-to-day work and play I was able to open 2-0+ tabs in Chrome and stream music, watch videos on the Amazon Prime Video app, and play a game downloaded from the Google Play Store with no hitching or performance issues.\n' +
      "This tablet is no speed demon, but if you just need it for basic web browsing and entertainment you'll have no complaints.\n" +
      '**Battery life:** The Duet 3 lasted roughly 10 hours and 30 minute in our battery test, which is good enough that you can carry it to a day of classes without having to worry about plugging in. In my own hands-on time using the tablet at home, I found I could reliably use it sparingly for a few days and still count on having upwards of 70% battery life when I picked it up.\n' +

No other laptop on the market can match the Framework in this regard, so if you care about being able to repair and upgrade your laptop, this is the one for you.\n" +
      "**✅ You're plagued by port envy:** On most laptops, the ports it comes with are all you get.

      "I was initially excited about those promises but dubious the company could deliver on them without some glaring sacrifices. But now that I’ve used one myself, I’m happy to report the Framework Laptop is as good as advertised. The updated Framework Laptop 13 the company shipped in 2023 only reinforced my opinions. With its intentionally easy-to-repair design (you can pop pieces off this laptop and get at the innards in minutes, with no tools besides the spudger it comes with) and super cool swappable Expansion Card ports, the Framework Laptop 13 is a versatile ultraportable that's one of the best laptops you can buy if you care about your right to repair and tinker with your devices.\n" +
      "**Design:** The Framework sports a simple silver aluminum chassis that blends right in with all the other laptops in the coffee shop, until you spot the Framework gear logo on the lid. At 11.67 x 9 x 0.62 inches in size and just 2.8 pounds, this DIY ultraportable is just as thin and even a hair lighter than Apple's [MacBook Air with M1](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/macbook-air-2020-m1), an especially incredible feat when you realize the Framework achieves that 0.62-inch thinness while still being modular and full of easy to access, mostly user-replaceable parts that, unlike a MacBook, aren't needlessly soldered to the mainboard in a way that makes repairing or upgrading a MacBook nearly impossible.\n" +
      "**Display:** The Framework's 13.5-inch display is sharp and functional, and its relatively7 rare 2,256 x 1,504 resolution (a byproduct of the 3:2 aspect ratio) is well-suited for viewing webpages and text. It also gets plenty bright in person, though you'll probably be frustrated if you try using it outdoors in direct sun.\n" +
      "**Performance:** While the Framework I tested performed well under pressure, the cooling fans are awfully loud and sometimes kick on even when doing light work like browsing the web. It also underperformed a bit in our performance benchmarks compared to a lot of its contemporaries. Our unit also fell a bit behind its contemporaries in our performance tests, so while it's great for work and some light gaming I wouldn't try taxing it with anything more serious.\n" +
      "**Battery life:** The Framework’s battery is good enough to get you through a day of work without needing to pack a charger, which is great to see in a productivity laptop. The Framework lasted 11 hours and 38 minutes in our battery test, which as you'll see from the chart of test results is quite good compared to some other laptops on this page.\n" +

      'Buy it if\n' +
      "**✅ You want a gaming laptop you can take to class:** You can find gaming laptops with lower price tags, bigger screens or more powerful innards, but you won't find many with better battery life, or that look as good on a desk. The Zephyrus G14 stands apart from the crowd by being powerful to play the latest games, yet performant and low-profile enough to double as a work laptop.\n" +
      "**✅ You want an all-AMD gaming machine:** PC diehards have strong feelings about Intel vs. AMD vs. Nvidia components. If you prefer an all-AMD laptop, the Zephyrus G14 can deliver that, and the much-ballyhooed efficiency of AMD components may have something to do with this laptop's remarkable battery life.\n" +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      "**❌ You want more than 14 inches:** The 14-inch (2,560 x 1,600 pixels) 120Hz display on the Zephyrus G14 is great, but it's a little small to really enjoy playing games to full effect. You could always hook the laptop up to one of the [best gaming monitors](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-gaming-monitors,review-3114.html), but if you want a larger canvas for gaming on the go you should look elsewhere.\n" +
      "❌ **Webcam quality matters:** The 720p webcam in the latest ROG Zephyrus G14 leaves a lot to be desired, and if you use it for streaming you'll hardly look your best. That said, earlier Zephyrus G14 models didn't even have webcams, so at least you get one this time around.\n" +
      'The bottom line\n' +
      "💻 **The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14** is a great gaming laptop, delivering a potent blend of performance, portability and power efficiency. The bright 16:10 120Hz display makes games and movies look great, while the speakers sound good enough that you won't feel compelled to use headphones.\n" +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      "The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is one of the [best gaming laptops](https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-gaming-laptops) on the market for most people because it's powerful, easy to carry and offers best-in-class battery life (for a gaming laptop). The newer models offer a better, brighter screen than earlier models, with good speakers and an AMD CPU/GPU combo that delivers solid gaming performance. This model also has a webcam built into the top bezel of the display, a convenience for video calls that earlier models lacked.\n" +
      "However, the Zephyrus G14 can't always deliver better performance than similarly-priced gaming laptops, and the webcam isn't very good. Still, you'd have a hard time finding a better gaming laptop (that can also double as a work or school laptop) for this price.\n" +
      '**Design:** The Zephyrus G14 measures 12.28 x 8.94 x 0.77 inches, weighs 3.79 pounds and looks good in Asus’ bright Moonlight White color scheme. The rounded corners and tapered edges balance out the sharp diagonal vents scattered across the chassis, and the optional and eye-catching AniMe Matrix mini-LED display on the back of the lid is a $600 cosmetic upgrade that will definitely turn heads.\n' +
      '**Display:** The 14-inch WQXGA (2,560 x 1,600 pixels) display on the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2022) looks great, and with its 16:10 aspect ratio I had no trouble juggling a lot of open windows on the desktop. The 120Hz refresh rate, 3ms response time and support for Dolby Vision HDR ensure the display is well-suited to making games and movies look their best.\n' +
      "**Performance:** Gaming performance is what matters in a laptop like this, and the 2022 Zephyrus G14 delivers if you configure it right. Our well-equipped review unit to hit 30-40 frames per second in Cyberpunk 2077 on max settings. However, that was with the help of AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution upscaling tech. In general, this laptop can run the [best PC games](https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-PC-games) quite well, and it has no trouble with basic productivity tasks.\n" +
      "**Battery life:** The Asus Zephyrus G14 (2022) lasted roughly 10 hours and 14 minutes in our Tom's Guide battery test, and barely over an hour when gaming. That's great web browsing time for a gaming laptop, so this is a great choice if you want a gaming machine that can also last through a day of classes.\n" +

      "**✅ You want a fast MacBook:** While it can't match the video-crunching power of the beefier M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBook Pros, the M3-equipped 14-inch MacBook Pro 2023 is one of the fastest laptops on the block.\n" +
      "**✅Battery life is key:** The 2023 MacBook Pro sets a high-water mark for battery life when we tested it, lasting over 17 hours in our battery endurance tests. That's one of the longest-lived laptops we've ever tested.\n" +
      "✅**You want Pro features for cheaper:** In killing the 13-inch MacBook Pro, Apple is giving its cheapest pro that gorgeous 120Hz Liquid Retina XDR display, some of the best speakers we've heard on a laptop, and more ports.\n" +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      "**❌ You don't like the notch:** With the benefits the adoption of the 14-inch model's design bring, one key drawback is the notch. If that's going to buy you, you may want to shop elsewhere.\n" +
      "**❌ You're looking for additional Pro power:** The standard 3nm chipset is good, but the M3 Pro and M3 Max do hold a lot more power potential — particularly in the graphics department.\n" +
      '❌ **Price-to-performance matters:** With a retail price of $1,599, the M3 MacBook Pro is relatively affordable. However, there are Windows machines at this price range that offer more horsepower like a dedicated GPU for gaming.\n' +
      'The bottom line\n' +
      '💻 **The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3** delivers blistering performance and an even brighter display along with surprisingly robust graphics and super-long battery life.\n' +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      "The new M3 MacBook Pro represents a big shift in Apple's laptop range, as the company (finally) [killed off its 13-inch model with Touch Bar](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/13-inch-macbook-pro-discontinued) in favor of the far more premium 14-inch frame.\n" +
      'Alongside this, it delivers mind-blowing performance along with a class-leading battery life, a Liquid Retina XDR display, full-height function keys, amazing speakers, and a class-leading battery life.\n' +
      '**Design:** The new MacBook Pro features that same unibody aluminum design that was previously reserved for the Pro and Max MacBook Pros. Gone is that classic look with the eyesore of a Touch Bar, and in its place is a utilitarian frame that comes with a somewhat distracting display notch.\n' +
      "Along the left side of the laptop you'll find the MagSafe charging port, two Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Over on the right you’ll find the HDMI port and SD Card slot.\n" +
      '**Display:** The MacBook Pro M3’s 14-inch, mini-LED Liquid Retina XDR display is still one of the best you’ll find on any laptop, even if it’s not as rich as an OLED panel. And Apple has boosted the brightness on the latest model when viewing SDR (standard dynamic range) content to 555 nits in our own testing.\n' +
      '**Performance:** The MacBook Pro’s M3 chip is the latest and greatest slice of Apple silicon, which is why this is one of the most powerful laptops on this list if you care about demanding work like photo/video editing or game development.\n' +
      "Our testing reveals this beast is at least 20% faster than the [13-inch MacBook Pro M2](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/macbook-pro-13-inch-m2-2022), and it's a decent gaming laptop as well as it can run the latest titles like Lies of P at a smooth 60 FPS, with bells and whistles like hardware-accelerated ray tracing.\n" +
      "**Battery life:** In our battery testing our 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro lasted for 17 hours and 23 minutes. That's admittedly not quite as long as the 18:20 delivered the 13-inch MacBook Pro M2, but with that model now discontinued this is the new top dog of Apple's laptops when it comes to battery life.\n" +
      'In short, the M3 MacBook Pro can easily last you through a full day of work and beyond. If you need great battery life, this is the longest-lasting laptop on this list.\n' +

      "**✅ You love 1600p resolution:** The Swift 5 is a great all-rounder, but one thing that sets it apart is its unique 2,560 x 1,600 display. That's effectively the 16:10 equivalent to 1440p, and if you love the idea of a taller, higher-res display on your Windows laptop this is one of the few to deliver it.\n" +
      "**✅ You want a MacBook Air M2 competitor for less:** Acer gave the 2022 Swift 5 a smart redesign and a component upgrade that helps it rival premium ultraportables like Apple's MacBook Air or Dell's XPS 13, but the Swift 5 costs a bit less than either.\n" +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      "**❌ You want to play a lot of games:** The beautiful 1600p display makes what you do on the Swift 5 look great, but you won't be doing a lot of high-intensity gaming with just an Intel CPU and no discrete GPU.\n" +
      '**❌ You hate bloatware:** Almost every new PC comes with some software pre-installed, but Acer really takes it up a notch. You’ll find unnecessary apps like Booking. com, Simple Mahjong, Planet9 Link, Aura Privacy, ExpressVPN, Forge of Empires, and other programs that aren’t part of a vanilla Windows 11 install on a new Swift 5, which is a hassle to clear out.\n' +
      'The bottom line\n' +
      "💻 **The Acer Swift 5**, with its great 1600p display, fast SSD, a great design — and a good price — represents a very strong value compared to similarly-specced competitors. Those looking for a productivity notebook will especially appreciate its 16:10 display, which makes it easier to view documents and spreadsheets. However, it's not an ideal gaming platform, and its battery life could be better.\n" +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      'The Acer Swift 5 (2022) is a svelte Windows laptop sporting a slick design, a gorgeous 1600p display and a speedy enough 12th-gen Intel chip onboard to get you through a day of work. It’s also cheaper than its chief rivals when comparably equipped.\n' +
      "While this laptop has some flaws, it's a great machine that delivers a lot of value for its sub-$2k price tag.\n" +
      '**Design:** While older Swift 5 laptops looked pretty generic, the 2022 model has a beautiful design with eye-catching edges decked out in a double-anodized gold treatment.\n' +
      "Measuring 12.2 x 8.4 x 0.59 inches and weighing just 2.65 pounds, the Acer Swift 5 is thicker than Apple's MacBook Air but also a hair lighter. The Acer Swift 5 feels sturdy despite its light weight thanks to its resilient aluminum chassis, and our review unit had a beautiful diamond pattern traced on it in gold lines that are as thin as a human hair, according to Acer.\n" +
      '**Display:** The Acer Swift 5’s 14-inch panel looks beautiful, and its WQXGA resolution (2560x1600, or 1600p) ensures it can deliver more pixels on-screen than more traditional 1080p or 1440p laptop displays.\n' +
      'The display offers a 16:10 aspect ratio, and in our testing the big, wide screen was easy to digest at a glance and made the games and movies we watched on it look great.\n' +
      "**Performance:** The Acer Swift 5 is plenty speedy thanks to its Intel CPU and 16GB of RAM. While this machine can't achieve the same speeds as other, more expensive laptops on this list, like the M3 MacBook Pro, it's plenty powerful enough for getting work done.\n" +
      "And while you shouldn't expect to play the latest and greatest games at max settings on this laptop, less demanding games like [Fortnite](https://www.tomsguide.com/tag/fortnite), Rocket League, and League of Legends can be enjoyed for hours with decent-looking graphics courtesy of the laptop's integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics chipset.\n" +
      "**Battery life:** Sadly, we've hit the one disappointing point in this otherwise glowing overview. While the Acer Swift 5 is a stunning little Windows laptop that's plenty good enough for what it costs, the fact that it barely lasted over 11 hours in our battery test was a little disappointing.\n" +
      "Don't get me wrong, it's still longer-lasting than most Windows laptops, including a few on this list. But our battery test is done under controlled conditions with the screen kept quite dim, and in the real world when you're perhaps using it in the bright sun or playing games on it, it will last a lot less time. In our review we noticed that using the laptop normally at max brightness caused it to conk out in about 5 hours, which is disappointing. Thankfully, it does charge quickly.\n" +

      "✅ **You love ultraportables**: The Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED is one of the thinnest laptops out there — which is impressive for a 2-in-1\\. Because of its svelte design and light weight, it's easy to carry around wherever you go.\n" +
      "✅ **You want an OLED display**: You don't usually see OLED panels on laptops under $1,000 — which makes the Zenbook 14 Flip all the more attractive. This display doesn't get too bright, but its rich picture quality makes up for that.\n" +
      "✅ **You want a 2-in-1:** This one is obvious, but if you want a device that's both a laptop and tablet, the Zenbook 14 Flip OLED is worth considering, especially for its excellent $999 asking price.\n" +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      '**❌ You need long battery life:** 9 hours of battery life used to be great, but not so in a world of MacBooks that can last 15 hours or more. So if you want more than 12 hours of battery life, you might want to look elsewhere.\n' +
      "**❌ You want a good webcam:** If you want to look your best during video calls, then this Zenbook 14 Flip OLED's ancient 720p won't do you any favors.\n" +
      'The bottom line\n' +
      "💻 The Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED is a premium 2-in-1 because it's sturdy, looks great on a desk and comes with plenty of power (and plenty of ports) to get things done. The vivid 2.8K OLED display is the cherry on top that makes everything you do on this laptop look nice. It doesn't have the muscle for serious gaming, but if you want to browse the web, watch movies and read comics this is a great 2-in-1 for you.\n" +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      "The Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED has a gorgeous display that's ideal for watching videos, and it has one of the best laptop keyboards we’ve tested in a long time. It's also a decent performer, so you don't have to deal with the slow loading and weak gaming potential of some other 2-in-1 laptops.\n" +
      "However, it's not perfect. The webcam isn't great, and the battery life can leave you wanting. The light-up LED number pad on the touchpad is a nice touch, but it can be annoying if you don't like it.\n" +
      'That said, this is inarguably one of the best 2-in-1 laptops on the market because it performs well, looks great and offers plenty of ports for a price that never gets higher than $1,300.\n' +
      "**Design:** Measuring 12.2 x 8.8 x 0.6 inches and weighing 3.3 pounds ensures the Zenbook 14 Flip is a great travel laptop. While it's not as thin and light as the 13-inch [MacBook Air M2](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/macbook-air-2022-m2) or some other laptops on this list, it's easy to carry from room to room and not a hassle to throw in a backpack to take with you to school.\n" +
      '**Display:** One of the main selling points of this laptop is its 14-inch 2.8K OLED panel, and it delivers both in our own hands-on testing and in our performance testing lab, achieving bright brights, deep darks and beautiful contrasts between light and shadow. A good OLED panel makes everything you do on it look better, and this laptop is no exception.\n' +
      "**Performance:** The 13th Gen Intel Core CPU and 16GB of RAM in our Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED review unit ensure that this thin-and-light laptop doesn't straggle when it comes time to work. While this laptop can't exactly tear through big video editing projects or play the latest and greatest games at ultra-high settings, it's more than good enough for work and play.\n" +
      "**Battery life:** In our battery test the Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED lasted for 8 hours and 53 minutes, which is good but not great. It's acceptable and not a huge hassle if you don't plan to carry it around for a full day, but if you do it's kind of a bummer that you need to bring a charger with you or else risk running out of juice at a key moment.\n" +

      "✅ **You want a laptop that does it all:** From getting work done to gaming to watching videos, the Galaxy Book3 Ultra is great for all of it. It's a potent blend of beauty and power with good battery life and an affordable price tag.\n" +
      "**✅ You love gaming on OLED:** OLED displays deliver remarkably bright brights, inky blacks and striking contrasts. The Samsung Galaxy Book3 Ultra's 3K 120Hz AMOLED screen looks great, and its beefy internals ensure games look great on it.\n" +
      "**✅ You're already enmeshed in Samsung's ecosystem:** The Galaxy Book3 Ultra is great at gaming and getting work done, especially if you own other Samsung Galaxy devices. That's because Samsung Galaxy designs them to work well together, so you have an easier time sharing files between devices and generally making better use of them in concert.\n" +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      "**❌ You hate Samsung bloatware:** The Galaxy Book2 Pro 360 comes with a ton of Samsung software pre-installed, and its all bloatware if you don't own any other Samsung devices.\n" +
      "**❌ You love customizability:** This is a great all-around laptop but it only comes in a very limited number of configs, so you don't get much variety in terms of RAM, storage, etc.\n" +
      'The bottom line\n' +
      '💻 **The Samsung Galaxy Book3 Ultra** is one of the best Windows laptops you can buy, delivering great performance, a gorgeous display and a comfy keyboard for not too much money, especially when you consider it packs a discrete Nvidia 40-series laptop GPU.\n' +
      '**What you need to know**\n' +
      'The Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Ultra (starting at $2,199) isn’t just the first Samsung laptop with Ultra branding. It’s the company’s direct answer to the [MacBook Pro 16-inch (2023)](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/macbook-pro-16-inch-2023-review). With a 16-inch OLED display, an Intel 13th Gen Core CPU and an [Nvidia RTX 40-series](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4000) GPU, Samsung’s laptop seems to have what it takes to challenge Apple’s powerful premium notebook.\n' +
      'Comparisons aside, the Galaxy Book 3 Ultra has a lot to offer. Its powerful specs make it suitable for video editing and for playing the [best PC games](https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-PC-games). In fact, this is one of the [best gaming laptops](https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-gaming-laptops) we’ve tested. Toss in interoperability with Samsung phones and tablets, and this could be a brilliant laptop for folks invested in the Samsung ecosystem.\n' +
      '**Design:** The Galaxy Book 3 Ultra is a sleek and elegant laptop that’s well-suited for work and play. At 13.9 x 9.8 x 0.6 inches and weighing 3.9 pounds, this machined aluminum notebook is easy to hold and carry around. Not only is it a bit thinner than the MacBook Pro 16-inch 2023, but it’s almost a pound lighter.\n' +
      "**Display:** The Galaxy Book 3 Ultra's gorgeous 120Hz AMOLED display makes everything you do on it look better. It really impressed when gaming, with the likes of Cyberpunk 2077's Night City looking incredible thanks to the vibrant neon colors and lights of the game popping on the Book 3 Ultra's OLED screen. Once you've experienced a high-quality OLED display on a laptop, you'll be hard pressed to go back to all but the finest LCD laptop screens.\n" +
      '**Performance:** The Book3 Ultra is uniquely well-suited to both work and play thanks to its speedy CPU and discrete GeForce RTX 40-series laptop GPU, which give it enough power to double as a decent gaming laptop. The 16GB of included RAM make it feel plenty snappy for a productivity notebook.\n' +
      "**Battery life:** The Galaxy Book3 Ultra lasted for a smidge over 10 hours in our battery test, which is great for a gaming laptop but pretty unremarkable when compared to the other laptops on this list. It will probably get you through a work day, especially if you don't tax it too hard, but you might want to carry a charger just in case.\n" +

      "✅ **You need to edit 8K videos:** If you're a professional video editor, there's no Apple laptop more powerful than the MacBook Pro 16-inch with M3 Max. This laptop will likely pay for itself over time with how much time it could save you.\n" +
      "**✅ You like playing high-end games on Mac:** Gaming on Macs has always been dubious but it's better than ever thanks to the M3 family of chips. Games like Baldur's Gate 3 and Lies of P showcase how fast and fluid games can run on the latest Macs.\n" +
      "**✅ You want a MacBook that'll last for years:** M1 MacBooks are still viable so it stands to reason that M3-driven notebooks could potentially last you even longer. This should justify the admittedly high initial price.\n" +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      "**❌ You don't want to spend so much money:** The MacBook Pro 16-inch with M3 Max starts at $3,499 and can get as high as $7,199 when fully decked out. This is not a machine for those on a budget.\n" +
      "**❌ You own a MacBook Pro M2 Max:** The M3 Max MacBook Pro is roughly 20% faster than its M2 Max-driven predecessor. While that's impressive, it means you don't have to update to M3 Max if you have an M2 Max laptop.\n" +
      'The bottom line\n' +
      '💻 **The MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Max, 2023)** retains the same fetching design and gorgeous mini-LED display as the previous M2 Max model, this premium laptop’s performance is currently second to none. That hefty $3.5k starting price tag is a significant chunk of change, but professional creatives and even gamers will get their money’s worth.\n' +
      "**What you need to know:** The 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Max chip is one of the most powerful laptops we’ve ever tested. That's not a huge surprise since we said that about its predecessor the [MacBook Pro 16-inch with the M2 Max](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/macbook-pro-16-inch-2023-review) chip, but it remains amazing that Apple's own chips can deliver this much power and efficiency in a laptop.",

    title: 'Best Laptops Under $2000 in 2024',
    text:
      'https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/best-laptop/ Best Laptop of 2024 ? Joshua Goldman\n' +
      "There are a ton of laptops on the market at any given moment, and almost all of those models are available in multiple configurations to match your performance and budget needs. So if you're feeling overwhelmed with options when looking for a new laptop, it's understandable. To help simplify things for you, here are the main things you should consider when you start looking.\n" +
      '# Price\n' +
      "The search for a new laptop for most people starts with price. If the statistics chipmaker Intel and PC manufacturers hurl at us are correct, you'll be holding onto your next laptop for at least three years. If you can afford to stretch your budget a little to get better specs, do it. And that stands whether you're spending $500 or more than $1,000\\. In the past, you could get away with spending less upfront with an eye toward upgrading memory and storage in the future. But laptop makers are increasingly moving away from making components easily upgradable, so again, it's best to get as much laptop as you can afford from the start.\n" +
      "Generally speaking, the more you spend, the better the laptop. That could mean better components for faster performance, a nicer display, sturdier build quality, a smaller or lighter design from higher-end materials or even a more comfortable keyboard. All of these things add to the cost of a laptop. I'd love to say $500 will get you a powerful gaming laptop, for example, but that's not the case. Right now, the sweet spot for a reliable laptop that can handle average work, home office or school tasks is between $700 and $800 and a reasonable model for creative work or gaming upwards of about $1,000\\. The key is to look for discounts on models in all price ranges so you can get more laptop for less.\n" +
      '# Operating system\n' +
      "Choosing an operating system is part personal preference and part budget. For the most part, Microsoft Windows and Apple's MacOS do the same things (except for gaming, where Windows is the winner), but they do them differently. Unless there's an OS-specific application you need, go with the one you feel most comfortable using. And if you're not sure which that is, head to an Apple store or a local electronics store and test them out. Or ask friends or family to let you test theirs for a bit. If you have an iPhone or iPad and like it, chances are you'll like MacOS, too.\n" +
      "But when it comes to price and variety (and, again, PC gaming), Windows laptops win. If you want MacOS, you're getting a MacBook. While Apple's MacBooks regularly top our best lists, the least expensive one is the M1 MacBook Air for $999\\. It is regularly discounted to $750 or $800, but if you want a cheaper MacBook, you'll have to consider older refurbished ones.\n" +
      "Windows laptops can be found for as little as a couple of hundred dollars and come in all manner of sizes and designs. Granted, we'd be hard-pressed to find a $200 laptop we'd give a full-throated recommendation to, but if you need a laptop for online shopping, email and word processing, they exist.\n" +
      "If you are on a tight budget, consider a Chromebook. ChromeOS is a different experience than Windows; make sure the applications you need have a [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions), Android or Linux app before making the leap. But if you spend most of your time roaming the web, writing, streaming video or using cloud-gaming services, they're a good fit.\n" +
      '# Size\n' +
      "Remember to consider whether having a lighter, thinner laptop or a touchscreen laptop with a good battery life will be important to you in the future. Size is primarily determined by the screen -- hello, laws of physics -- which in turn factors into battery size, laptop thickness, weight and price. And keep in mind other physics-related characteristics, such as an ultrathin laptop isn't necessarily lighter than a thick one, you can't expect a wide array of connections on a small or ultrathin model and so on.\n" +
      '# Screen\n' +
      "When it comes to deciding on a screen, there are a myriad number of considerations: how much you need to display (which is surprisingly more about resolution than screen size), what types of content you'll be looking at and whether or not you'll be using it for gaming or creative work.\n" +
      "You really want to optimize pixel density; that is, the number of pixels per inch the screen can display. Though there are other factors that contribute to sharpness, a higher pixel density usually means sharper rendering of text and interface elements. (You can easily calculate the pixel density of any screen at [DPI Calculator](https://www.sven.de/dpi/) if you don't feel like doing the math, and you can also find out what math you need to do there.) We recommend a dot pitch of at least 100 pixels per inch (ppi) as a rule of thumb.\n" +
      "Because of the way Windows and MacOS scale for the display, you're frequently better off with a higher resolution than you'd think. You can always make things bigger on a high-resolution screen, but you can never make them smaller -- to fit more content in the view -- on a low-resolution screen. This is why a 4K, 14-inch screen may sound like unnecessary overkill, but may not be if you need to, say, view a wide spreadsheet.\n" +
      "If you need a laptop with relatively accurate color, that displays the most colors possible or that supports HDR, you can't simply trust the specs -- not because manufacturers lie, but because they usually fail to provide the necessary context to understand what the specs they quote mean. You can find a ton of detail about considerations for different types of screen uses in our monitor buying guides for [general purpose monitors](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/monitors-buying-guide/), [creators](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/how-to-buy-a-laptop-to-edit-photos-videos-or-other-creative-tasks/), [gamers and HDR viewing](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/how-to-choose-an-hdr-gaming-monitor/).\n" +
      '# Processor\n' +
      "The processor, aka the CPU, is the brains of a laptop. Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for Windows laptops. Both offer a staggering selection of mobile processors. Making things trickier, both manufacturers have chips designed for different laptop styles, like power-saving chips for ultraportables or faster processors for gaming laptops. Their naming conventions will let you know what type is used. You can head to [Intel's](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000028083/processors.html) or [AMD's](https://www.amd.com/en/processors/ryzen-processors-laptop) sites for explanations so you get the performance you want. Generally speaking, though, the faster the processor speed and the more cores it has, the better the performance will be.\n" +
      "Apple makes its own chips for MacBooks, which makes things slightly more straightforward. But, like Intel and AMD, you'll still want to pay attention to the naming conventions to know what kind of performance to expect. Apple uses its M-series chipsets in Macs. The entry-level MacBook Air uses an M1 chip with an eight-core CPU and seven-core GPU. The current models have M2-series silicon that starts with an eight-core CPU and 10-core GPU and goes up to the M2 Max with a 12-core CPU and a 38-core GPU. Again, generally speaking, the more cores it has, the better the performance.\n" +
      '# Graphics\n' +
      'The graphics processor (GPU) handles all the work of driving the screen and generating what gets displayed, as well as speeding up a lot of graphics-related (and increasingly, AI-related) operations. For Windows laptops, there are two types of GPUs: integrated (iGPU) or discrete (dGPU). As the names imply, an iGPU is part of the CPU package, while a dGPU is a separate chip with dedicated memory (VRAM) that it communicates with directly, making it faster than sharing memory with the CPU.\n' +
      "Because the iGPU splits space, memory and power with the CPU, it's constrained by the limits of those. It allows for smaller, lighter laptops, but doesn't perform nearly as well as a dGPU. In fact, there are some games and creative software that won't run unless they detect a dGPU or sufficient VRAM. Most productivity software, video streaming, web browsing and other nonspecialized apps will run fine on an iGPU, though.\n" +
      "For more power-hungry graphics needs, like video editing, gaming and streaming, design and so on, you'll need a dGPU; there are only two real companies that make them, Nvidia and AMD, with Intel offering some based on the Xe-branded (or the older UHD Graphics branding) iGPU technology in its CPUs.\n" +
      '# Memory\n' +
      "For memory, we highly recommend 16GB of RAM (8GB absolute minimum). RAM is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications, and it can fill up fast. After that, it starts swapping between RAM and SSD, which is slower. A lot of sub-$500 laptops have 4GB or 8GB, which in conjunction with a slower disk can make for a frustratingly slow Windows laptop experience. Also, many laptops now have the memory soldered onto the motherboard. Most manufacturers disclose this, but if the RAM type is LPDDR, assume it's soldered and can't be upgraded.\n" +
      "However, some PC makers will solder memory on and also leave an empty internal slot for adding a stick of RAM. You may need to contact the laptop manufacturer or find the laptop's full specs online to confirm. And check the web for user experiences, because the slot may still be hard to get to, it may require nonstandard or hard-to-get memory or other pitfalls.\n" +
      '# Storage\n' +
      "You'll still find cheaper hard drives in budget laptops and larger hard drives in gaming laptops, but faster solid-state drives (SSDs) have all but replaced hard drives in laptops. They can make a big difference in performance. But not all SSDs are equally speedy, and cheaper laptops typically have slower drives; if the laptop only has 4GB or 8GB of RAM, it may end up swapping to that drive and the system may slow down quickly while you're working.",

      '**Our favorite configuration:**\n' +
      "The [Asus ROG Strix Scar 16](https://www.gamesradar.com/asus-rog-strix-scar-16-2023-review/) has taken over from the [Razer](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/razer/) Blade 15 (still featured below) as the best gaming laptop we've had our hands on yet. This thing flies through anything you can throw at it, without reaching the dizzying heights of other premium RTX 40-Series rigs. That's because the Strix Scar puts its power exactly where a PC gaming enthusiast wants it - cooling, CPU efficiency, and GPU power - all while still offering a crisp set of RGB panels and a Mini LED display worthy of its next generation chassis.\n" +
      'Buy It If\n' +
      "**✅You prioritize performance over a slick chassis:** The Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 is a powerful machine, but it's certainly not the most expensive model on the market - because it doesn't try and squeeze those components into a more portable form factor.\n" +
      "**✅You value a high quality display:** That Mini LED display does add to the final price, but it's well worth the additional immersion for that crisp QHD+ resolution.\n" +
      "**✅You don't mind a more gamer-styled aesthetic:** The Strix isn't going to fade into the background - while you can turn those glaring LEDs off, the translucent body and chunky grills scream gaming laptop.\n" +
      "Don't Buy It If:\n" +
      "❌**You don't want to spend over $3,000:** The Strix series is at the top of Asus's range, so we're unlikely to see cheaper configurations surfacing. While it's good value in its price bracket, it's still a premium machine.\n" +
      '❌**You prefer a sleek form factor:** The extra space required to achieve such performance is a necessary evil here.\n' +
      "❌**You don't need the latest top of the range specs:** If your Steam library simply won't make the most of those top shelf graphics cards and processors, the Strix isn't going to be worth it.\n" +
      "**Design:** This isn't a machine for the more subtle amongst us, though. While the RGB panel running across the lower lip can be switched off, this is still very much a gaming laptop. The translucent design across the main deck wasn't quite our favorite touch and does add to this gamer aesthetic while slightly cheapening the experience, but this is down to personal preference.\n" +
      "The lid sports a large ROG logo and a series of etched diagonal lines along the chunky grill towards the back, further removing this rig from your everyday office laptop. However, it's not such an in your face design, and putting those LEDs to sleep certainly keeps the vibe slick.\n" +
      "**Features:** We've also got one of the best screens we've had the pleasure of using on a gaming laptop. Asus has branded its Mini LED screens 'Nebula HDR', and they sing. Between 1,024 dimming zones and 1,100+ nits of peak brightness, colors pop with an excellent vividity and balance well with a deep, rich contrast. Throw in Dolby Atmos and a solid virtual surround system and you've got a seriously immersive experience.\n" +
      "That's, of course, backed up with a high-end set of configuration options. The ROG Strix Scar 16 can move up to an i9-13980HX CPU with an RTX 4090 card - those are specs that are sure to satisfy anyone looking for a top shelf rig.\n" +
      "**Performance:** We tested an RTX 4080 rig with the Intel i9-13980HX processor that comes with both this and the 4090 configuration, drawing a 17,611 Time Spy score and 32,876 Fire Strike score to beat out the [Asus ROG Zephyrus M16](https://www.gamesradar.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-review/) by some margin. The Scar 16 even beat the larger (and far more expensive RTX 4090-toting) [Razer Blade 18](https://www.gamesradar.com/razer-blade-18-review/) in these benchmark tests as well. Those are numbers that will comfortably see you through the next five years of gaming, and potentially much more if we don't see any particularly demanding graphical breakthroughs.\n" +
      "No, framerates weren't as impressive as the ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 listed below - but equally you're not spending an extra $1,000 on a fancy second screen (and the power to run it) you might not use. Plus, at three-figure framerates in Ultra settings across demanding titles, there's no arguing the raw horsepower baked into this machine.\n" +
      '> With HDR content represented in gorgeous detail and colors popping from the screen with excellent vibrancy, this is a real feast for the eyes.\n' +
      '>\n' +
      '> Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 review\n' +
      "**Verdict:** We're getting our hands on more RTX 40-Series gaming laptops all the time, but for now the Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 is the best model to pass our desks. It's well worth the investment for anyone on the hunt for a high-end machine with bags of power to spare for future releases.\n" +

      '### Reasons to buy\n' +
      '### Reasons to avoid\n' +
      '**Our favorite configuration:**\n' +
      "The [Alienware M15 R7](https://www.gamesradar.com/alienware-m15-r7-review/) brought the now mid-range line of luxury laptops up to 2022's standards last year, and while current sales hold out it's the go-to for anyone after a performance punching machine in 2023\\. With Intel's 12th generation processors and Nvidia's Ti GPUs at the helm, there's some serious power up for grabs here.\n" +
      'Buy It If\n' +
      '**✅You need all-round power across a range of genres:** The M15 R7 is well suited for a massive range of games, offering excellent performance at a solid mid-range price.\n' +
      "**✅You're a more competitive player:** With its super-fast display and Ethernet port, this is a machine built with competition in mind.\n" +
      '**✅You want to save by opting for an older machine:** The R7 has been superseded by the M16 in 2023, which makes it a generation behind. However, that means we regularly see it on sale.\n' +
      "Don't Buy It If\n" +
      "❌**You travel regularly with your laptop:** The Alienware M15 R7 weighs in at just under 6lbs (2.7kg) and packs a massive charger to boot. This isn't a backpack friendly machine.\n" +
      "❌**You want the latest components:** As a previous generation machine, you're locked into RTX 30-Series graphics cards and Intel's 12th generation processors. There's still plenty of power here, but not quite as much value as a newer build.\n" +
      '❌ **You want a luxury chassis:** Alienware shaves the price of its M-Series devices by dropping the premium build materials of its X-Series.\n' +
      "**Design:** It's worth noting that this machine is built purely for power. It's a stocky design, and a particularly heavy one at that - the charging brick alone nearly runs the full length of the keyboard. So no, this isn't going to be a gaming laptop you'll easily throw into a backpack - and those fans can certainly scream - but if you're looking for an all-rounder that can level with machines far pricier than itself, these are easy sacrifices to make.\n" +
      'Everything is as you would expect from an [Alienware](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/alienware/) laptop, from the slim-bezel design on the face to the 15 watermark on the back - and of course that RGB strip running around the rear port area. The matte finish works hard to cover up a cheaper plastic chassis, but everything still feels durable - despite some considerable flex in the screen.\n' +
      "**Features:** The M15 R7 certainly doesn't disappoint when it comes to connectivity. There's a massive selection of ports here, so you're covered whether you're on the USB-C or USB-A train, and whether you prefer WiFi or Ethernet. The keyboard also manages to delight, with a taller 1.8mm travel distance and a tactile feel this is a particularly satisfying set of keys for both gameplay and typing.\n" +
      'Up top, our test unit sported a 360Hz FHD display which proved particularly adept at motion handling and tear reduction thanks to that incredible speed. We did notice lighter colors handling a little worse than darks, being a little washed out overall, but everything came together nicely even in bright conditions.\n' +
      "**Performance:** We were blown away by the performance of this machine. Our test unit featured an i7-12700H processor and an RTX 3070 Ti graphics card, and was easily sailing through our benchmarks and stress tests. This beast didn't even flinch at heavier titles like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Metro Exodus - offering up 76fps in RDR2's Ultra settings, and 72fps with all RTX set to max in Metro Exodus. Those are settings that would make the uber expensive RTX 3080 Ti Razer Blade 15 sweat.\n" +
      '> Faster action titles ran without a hitch, with that 360Hz refresh rate display acting as the cherry on the stunningly powerful cake.\n' +
      '>\n' +
      '> Alienware M15 R7 review\n' +
      "**Verdict:** Alienware is, after all, a luxury brand. With its M-series now falling to the middle of its range (thanks to the advent of the X-series), the Alienware M15 R7 is affordable _by the brand's standards. _ That means you'll find far cheaper machines out there, but without that Alienware pedigree to speak of. Still, with performance to rival some of the best gaming laptops in the business, and only a few sacrifices to get there for a great price, this is an excellent option for most players. You could consider the X15 technically the [best Alienware gaming laptop](https://www.gamesradar.com/alienware-gaming-laptop-guide/) on paper alone, but when it comes down to price and the wider market, this is the winner.\n" +

      '### Reasons to buy\n' +
      '### Reasons to avoid\n' +
      '**Our favorite configuration:**\n' +
      'It’s not about to blow anyone away with flashy features or top-tier performance, but the [Acer Nitro 5](https://www.gamesradar.com/acer-nitro-5-2022-review/) is a very respectable choice of gaming laptop for the busy gamer who doesn’t want to break the bank.\n' +
      'Buy It If:\n' +
      "**✅ You want high-end components without breaking the bank:** The Acer Nitro 5 manages to pack some solid components without bumping the price up. That's because there are sacrifices elsewhere, but it does mean great value for money.\n" +
      "**✅You're buying your first gaming laptop:** With its low price and entry level features, the Nitro 5 is the perfect starter laptop. Use this for a couple of years to decide what you really value in a rig before you make a big purchase.\n" +
      "**✅You play casually and not every day:** If you don't think you'll be able to warrant the higher price tag of a more sophisticated machine with your daily use, it's well worth picking up a cheaper runner.\n" +
      "Don't Buy It If:\n" +
      "❌ **You need a particularly fast display:** The Acer Nitro 5 display isn't particularly impressive and has certainly been sacrificed to keep that price low.\n" +
      "❌ **You prioritize aesthetics:** Its older style aesthetics have been outdated for a while now, so that chunky, angular design won't be to everybody's taste.\n" +
      "❌ **You're looking for a longer term investment:** These are older laptops, so they're not going to be able to keep up with more demanding games of tomorrow.\n" +
      "**Design:** The [Acer](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/acer/) Nitro line has a distinct look about it, the most recent Nitro 5 doesn't stray too far. It's a plastic chassis which can collect fingerprints quickly, but feels remarkably durable in the hand. It also helps that at 2.3kg this is one of the lighter gaming laptops on the market right now. Yes, those bezels do keep the screen from looking its best and the angled corners and harsh lines feel a little old fashioned, but overall this is an inoffensive design scheme for a cheaper laptop.\n" +
      '**Features:** Regularly available for under $1,000 / £1,000, the RTX 3060 Nitro 5 manages to pack some impressive components into a budget price tag by dropping nice-to-have features. That makes it perfect for anyone after raw power without all the fancy extras that can sometimes bloat gaming laptop costs.\n' +
      "A good full-scale keyboard with numpad makes this laptop appropriate for both work and play. That means it's a great replacement for a full-tower desktop PC at home that also offers portability thanks to its relatively low weight as gaming laptops go. We found the screen to be somewhat dull compared to other laptops in the same price range, and the battery life is decidedly unimpressive, but given the budget cost, these do feel like fair tradeoffs. Especially since the display does retain an excellent 144Hz refresh rate.\n" +
      '**Performance:** The RTX 3060 GPU paired with a Ryzen 5800H processor offered up strong performance in our testing, hitting 86fps in High settings on The Division 2, and only dropping to 77fps in Ultra. While the SSD could be a bit speedier, it’s not going to cause any major headaches. Most games will run above 60fps at maximum settings, and ray-tracing is also an option, though it does come with an associated performance hit.\n' +
      '> All but the most demanding games should run comfortably above 60fps at maximum graphical settings\n' +

      '> Acer Nitro 5 review\n' +
      "**Verdict:** We'd recommend the Nitro 5 to anyone after their first gaming laptop - it's the perfect way to spend less, get a few good years of gaming in, and work out exactly what you need from a larger purchase further down the line.\n" +
      "You'll also find excellent options in the [Dell](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/dell/) G15 and Asus TUF Dash F15\\. The former is generally found on sale for slightly less than the Acer Nitro 5, but doesn't quite pack the same thermal regulation. Meanwhile, Asus's budget option is pitched at a slightly higher price point, sacrificing processing power for a 1440p display.\n" +

      '**Our favorite configuration:**\n' +
      "The [Asus ROG Zephyrus G14](https://www.gamesradar.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-2023-review/) long reigned over the slimline gaming laptop world. It was one of the first easily portable machines, built with a form factor that respected your backpack and your desk top. In 2023, Asus has doubled down on its power. With RTX 40-Series graphics heralding a return to Nvidia (last year's [AMD](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/amd/) build was certainly speedy but dropped a few fancy graphical tricks), and Intel's 13th generation processors at the helm, the latest iteration embodies that classic power / portability balance.\n" +
      'Buy It If\n' +
      '**✅You travel regularly with your laptop:** Its 14-inch form factor is the giveaway here, but the G14 is particularly easy to transport thanks to its light weight and sturdy design.\n' +
      '**✅You want portability and power:** While the Alienware x14 prioritizes portability at the expense of more powerful components, the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 packs offers far greater choice.\n' +
      "**✅You don't want to dip below Ultra settings:** We noted that the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 performed pretty much just as well at Ultra as it did High. That efficiency means you won't need to make sacrifices in the settings menu here.\n" +
      "Don't Buy It If\n" +
      "❌ **You want the best display possible:** Asus has cut back on the power of its MiniLED display in this 14-incher which means things aren't quite as vibrant as other 2023 releases.\n" +
      "❌ **Weight is a key factor:** The G14 is certainly compact, but it's got nothing on the slimline Alienware x14 when it comes to the scales. If you're looking for an ultralight experience, and you don't need all this power, Dell has it in the bag.\n" +
      "**Design:** The G14 nailed its aesthetic and build a long time ago, and the 2023 iteration only improves this slick but compact design ethos. The magnesium alloy chassis keeps things feeling dense and secure while still endlessly portable thanks to those soft rounded corners and 1.7kg weight. The AniMe Matrix LED display is still available, but we'd recommend avoiding it for a cheaper final price if you can. However, both models still look subtle enough to sit in a professional or gaming space.\n" +
      "One of our favorite design aspects was the hinge, though. Like in previous models, lifting the lid also angles the body of the laptop, creating space for extra ventilation and creating a floating effect. It's a luxury aesthetic that works hard to keep your laptop running at its best at the same time.\n" +
      "**Features:** While last year's venture into AMD graphics had us wanting a little more from the G14, 2023's return to Nvidia is triumphant. There's plenty of choice here as well, with configurations spanning all the way from RTX 4060 to RTX 4090\\.\n" +
      "You're still getting the 16:10 display introduced on the previous model, but at the top RTX 4090 tier Asus has added its Nebula HDR MiniLED panel. While a jump from IPS in its own right, though, this screen has had its specs trimmed to slot into the Zephyrus G14's bracket. Whereas other 2023 Asus laptops are wowing with their vibrant 1,100 nits of peak brightness and 1,024 dimming zones, the G14 trades down to 600 nits and 504 zones. That's a noticeable sacrifice having had the other models in-hand.\n" +
      "**Performance:** We managed to squeeze some impressive numbers out of this compact design as well. Consistently hitting well over 120fps in in-game benchmarks at a High setting, and holding that performance pretty well across Ultra, those new generation components certainly aren't put to waste in this smaller chassis. Whether you're in 1080p or 1440p, everything is silky smooth.\n" +
      'We did notice those temperatures creeping under intense workloads, though, so this will be one to keep on a desk rather than a lap. That said, not many 14-inch rigs can keep up with these specs, and even fewer can do so with the extra screen space afforded to you here.\n' +

      '>\n' +
      '> Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 review\n' +
      "**Verdict:** The G14 is the best 14-inch gaming laptop we've had our hands on so far. It manages to combine power and portability in a package that very few rigs can match. You're getting better value for money, more component choices, and lower prices than the Alienware x14, making it the go-to for anyone after a compact PC.\n" +

      "We got our hands on a beast of a [Razer Blade 15](https://www.gamesradar.com/razer-blade-15-review-2022/), but it showed us just how powerful 15.6-inch gaming laptops can be. The RTX 3080 Ti / i9-12900H configuration I had on my desk was a true monster in its performance. However, this rig's ability to offer such performance while keeping the slimline chassis we've all come to know and love really cemented its top spot among the best gaming laptops on the market.\n" +
      'Buy If If:\n' +
      "**✅ You want a good looking laptop:** There's no doubt about it, the Razer Blade 15 looks good. A slick, slimline chassis with a matte black design fits into a range of scenarios well.\n" +
      "**✅ You want a 4K option:** We actually managed to squeeze some playable 4K framerates out of the Blade 15 - a rarity we didn't think possible from even the RTX 3080 Ti under the hood.\n" +
      '**✅ You need a machine for work, content creation, and play:** The display quality and sleek design means the Blade 15 is an incredibly versatile laptop, ready to take on anything you can throw at it.\n' +
      "Don't Buy It If\n" +
      "❌ **You value performance over aesthetics:** The Blade 15 is impressive, but it's not topping the charts. You can pick up better performance with an RTX 40-Series graphics card at the helm these days.\n" +
      "❌ **You don't want to spend more on luxury:** Razer comes with a tax, this is a luxury laptop after all. If you're not interested in paying more for that slick experience, you're better off with another brand.\n" +
      "❌ **You won't get the miles out of it:** If you're not going to be pushing the Blade 15 to its limits across work and play, its higher price might not make much sense.\n" +
      "**Design:** You know the drill by now. This is a Razer laptop, so expect a matte black brick with nothing but a shiny green Razer logo on the lid. The Blade 15 follows these design rules to a T, shimmying all those high-end components into a slimline build with nearly every detail paid due luxury attention. We say nearly every, because while this is a solid chassis, we did still notice some considerable flex in the display and wobble in the hinge. Still, this is as skinny as the majority of 15.6-inch laptops go - so there's only so much that back panel can take. The hinge itself proved to be super strong in our testing so we didn't have too many concerns.\n" +
      "**Features:** Opening the lid, you'll find a num-pad-less keyboard with extra ventilation underneath as well as a 4K display up top. This is a particularly strong screen - especially considering it managed to keep up with more demanding games in our benchmarking. Outside of performance numbers though, the vibrancy and clarity this panel will give all your games is unparalleled and certainly makes for a far more immersive experience.\n" +
      "Under the hood, Razer has managed to shove an RTX 3080 Ti into this chassis. At the time of review, only a handful of gaming laptops could boast this powerful GPU, and considering the i9 CPU it comes with there's plenty of power for those who can wrangle it.\n" +
      '**Performance:** I managed to run Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 74fps in 4K with everything turned up to 11 here. While more demanding titles still struggled in that UHD resolution, though, I was still impressed with the 60+ fps in 1440p on Red Dead Redemption 2 as well as the 78fps in the same resolution on The Division 2\\. I only needed to drop some more taxing visual effects to hit higher framerates in 4K, and everything looked incredible while doing so.\n' +

      "Of course, this is no cheap machine. The 2022 Razer Blade 15 starts at $2,499.99 for an RTX 3060 configuration. You're certainly paying for this luxury name here, but if you're on the hunt for one of the most technically capable machines in one of the most portable form factors, the cash is well invested.\n" +

      "The [Alienware M18](https://www.gamesradar.com/alienware-m18-review/) goes toe to toe with the Asus ROG Strix Scar 18 below in terms of sheer performance, but falls slightly behind the 'most powerful' title. However, with a range of configuration options, a slick design, and features more geared towards desktop usage, it's the best 18-inch gaming laptop overall in our books.\n" +
      'Buy it if:\n' +
      "✅ **You want big-screen gaming without too high a cost:** The Alienware M18 can be configured as low as $1,699.99\\. While that's still expensive, it's nowhere near the lofty price tags other machines of this scale regularly reach.\n" +
      "✅ **You're keeping your laptop on your desk:** With a 4.23kg weight, this thing isn't travelling too far. This is a supremely heavy laptop, with a larger footprint than most to boot. That means the Alienware M18 is perfect for those planning to keep their laptop firmly in place.\n" +
      "✅ **You don't want messy cables:** The majority of the M18's ports are located to the rear of the machine which means you can connect your desk setup without having cables spreading out from the sides. There are still a few handy USB-A and USB-C options on the sides for easy access as well.\n" +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      "❌ **You're a competitive player but still want QHD+:** The 165Hz rate on the QHD+ screen option is going to hold competitive players back. The FHD+ option is geared towards those more speed-inclined, though, with a whopping 480Hz refresh rate.\n" +
      '❌ **You want the best screen quality possible:** We noticed that the matte cover makes the screen considerably duller than its competitors, which also has an effect on color contrast.\n' +
      '❌ **You want more of an option to travel:** All 18-inch laptops are difficult to transport, but this particularly so. There are slimmer, lighter machines out there for those who would still like the option to take their show on the road.\n' +
      "**Design:** The Alienware M18 had a surprise for us when we first opened the box. Gently sloping the front lip to a thin taper means that the whole design _feels_ more manageable than the more boxy Strix Scar 18 below. No, this isn't a portable laptop by any means, you're still picking up a massive 410 x 319 x 25 mm footprint and a considerable 4.23kg weight, but that slicker design makes it look a little less chunky on a desk top. Elsewhere, you've got all the design staples of an Alienware rig. A cool aluminium lid sports an embossed 18 along the top, with the plastic main body holding onto the same gray aesthetic throughout. Of course, there's still a nice RGB light show to take in, with a more subtle approach than Asus'.\n" +
      "**Features:** Of course, the big player here is that 18-inch screen. Dell has made some interesting decisions with the specs it offers here, there are only two options; QHD+ 165Hz or FHD+ 480Hz. It would have been nice to have a middle option - both the Razer Blade 18 and Asus ROG Strix Scar 18 have found happy homes in the QHD+ 240Hz region. While motion is still slick, higher framerate games could stand to benefit a little more from improved handling overall. We also noticed that this display runs less bright than both Razer and Asus's options, and doesn't offer any additional HDR capabilities.\n" +
      "However, with an excellent port selection, 1080p webcam built in, and a full sized keyboard (with full sized number pad) this feels like a real desktop PC alternative. Working particularly hard in the M18's favor though, is the component options. With RTX 4060 configurations on the table at sub-$2,000 prices, the Alienware M18 is winning in the choice category. That's perfect if you're after big-screen entertainment but don't want to splash thousands on graphics cards you won't make the most of.\n" +
      "**Performance:** The Alienware M18 almost bested the Strix Scar 18 in our testing, even beating it in a handful of benchmarking scenarios. While the Asus rig remains top dog, though, there's still some incredible performance under the hood here. In fact, the M18 performed better in more demanding titles like Returnal and Total War: Three Kingdoms, and always packed three figure framerates well into the highest graphics settings in native resolution.\n" +
      "> Yes, Alienware has made some sacrifices along the way - in screen, speakers, and portability - but if you're after a desktop replacement that really can take over your setup, you're in the right place.\n" +
      '>\n' +
      '> Alienware M18 review\n' +
      "**Verdict:** The Alienware M18 does make a few sacrifices, but in doing so it manages to position itself as an incredibly versatile gaming laptop. You can configure it up to the high heavens if you have the budget, or keep things more grounded for big-screen gaming under $2,000\\. That's not something many 18-inchers can claim - and especially not machines that manage to squeeze this amount of power out of their components.\n" +

      '### Reasons to buy\n' +
      '### Reasons to avoid\n' +
      '**Our favorite configuration:**\n' +
      "18-inch gaming laptops are here, and while the majority struggle to define themselves against cheaper desktop PCs and infinitely more portable 16-inch laptops, the [Asus ROG Strix Scar 18](https://www.gamesradar.com/asus-rog-strix-scar-18-review/) just about wiggles its way into the top spot. After all with benchmark numbers putting it right at the top of our scoring table (and just toppling over the [Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo 16](https://www.gamesradar.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-16-2023-review/)), it's the most powerful rig we've tested to date. And that can't be ignored.\n" +
      'Buy It If:\n' +
      "**✅ Performance is your top priority:** There's no hiding it, the Scar 18 can work. If you're going all out on chasing the highest possible framerates (and making sure they're reliable), this is the best option we've found yet.\n" +
      "**✅ You have a larger desk setup:** That larger footprint commands quite the desk space. While this has been designed to stick close to your permanent setup, it's worth noting you'll need plenty of room to house it.\n" +
      "**✅ You're an RGB fan:** From the rear grill to the front lip, the Scar 18 shines bright with RGB LEDs. If you've got a setup built to take advantage of a more colorful design you're going to enjoy this one.\n" +
      "Don't Buy It If:\n" +
      '❌ **You need to travel with your laptop:** The Strix Scar 18 is by no means svelt enough to travel with on a daily basis, or even just regularly. If you need a companion for frequent trips, consider something smaller and lighter.\n' +
      "❌ **You want to keep cables tidy:** Each port is placed on the side, which is frustrating for a desk-bound giant. If stray cables are going to disturb your setup it's worth finding a model that keeps its IO on the back.\n" +
      "❌ **You prefer a more subtle aesthetic:** All those RGB lights certainly aren't subtle, but they can be switched off. The translucent plastic housing and bold angular lines on the lid can't though.\n" +
      "**Design:** Looks are subjective but the translucent plastic and RGB lights aren't the most subtle of aesthetics and won't be for everyone. That plastic chassis is a little disappointing in this price range... at first glance. Taking one look at the nearly $5,000 price tag on the all-aluminium [Razer Blade 18](https://www.gamesradar.com/razer-blade-18-review/) has us running back to this cheaper build, though. The plastic may feel a little less luxurious but it's solid, dense and feels durable under hand.\n" +
      "Instead, it's the ports that are going to get in the way of things. You're getting a solid selection, but placing each connection on the left or right flank of a gaming laptop designed to sit (and remain - this thing is 80% heavier than the Zephyrus G14) on a desk is an oversight. Those cables are going to get messy fast.\n" +
      "**Features:** Asus has steered clear of adding an expensive Mini LED display to its Scar 18, focusing the cost on its components instead, but we were still impressed by the clarity and contrast of this speedy 240Hz panel. Plus, this way we can enjoy the top of the range Intel i9-13980HX processor - and that's not something many gaming laptops can boast.\n" +
      "With a full sized (yes, including a number pad) keyboard, four excellent speakers, a MUX switch, and some strong cooling, there's still plenty going on here. That's a better feature set than the Razer Blade 18 (which neglects the number pad) in a chassis that stays lighter than the Alienware M18\\.\n" +
      "**Performance:** This is where we get to the good part. Before testing the Scar 18, the dual-screened Zephyrus Duo 16 was the best performing gaming laptop we'd had our hands on. Yes, the Duo 16 was pitching slightly lower numbers while running that second display - but on paper, the 18-incher has left it in the dust. With Fire Strike coming in at 34,507 and Time Spy pitching in with a 20,132 score, things were already off to a good start. It beat the RTX 4090 Razer Blade 18's 26,844 / 16,367 respective scores by a mile and levelled out with the 4090 Zephyrus's 36,768 / 15,713 numbers.\n" +
      "> Between extremely high framerates, rock-solid reliability, and even the option to output to 4K (with ray tracing no less), this is the best performance we've seen from a gaming laptop yet.\n" +
      '>\n' +
      '> Asus ROG Strix Scar 18 review\n' +
      "Throw in consistent 100+ framerates across top graphics settings in Returnal, Total War: Three Kingdoms, and Hitman 3 and it's obvious this is a powerful machine. The consistency of those scores makes this the most powerful gaming laptop we've tested yet.\n" +
      "**Verdict:** The Asus ROG Strix Scar 18 isn't going to be for everyone. In fact, it's for very few players at all. However, if you're after a desk top machine that also offers the option of portability every now and then it's the most powerful option we've tested so far.\n" +

      '### Specifications\n' +
      '### Reasons to buy\n' +
      '### Reasons to avoid\n' +
      '**Our favorite configuration:**\n' +
      "We previously had the super skinny [Alienware x14](https://www.gamesradar.com/alienware-x14-review/) in as the best slimline gaming laptop, but its drawbacks in the power department mean the slightly thicker but ultimately far more powerful [HP Omen Transcend 16](https://www.gamesradar.com/hp-omen-transcend-16-review/) has stolen the top spot. With components moving up to Intel 13th generation i9 processors and an RTX 4070 GPU there's plenty more choice here, and an excellently portable design to boot.\n" +
      'Buy it if:\n' +
      "**✅ You travel regularly with your laptop:** This is a slimline machine, especially by today's standards. Add that long battery life and 2.1kg weight into the mix and it's easy to carry around and work from.\n" +
      "✅ **You find value the mid-range:** With its RTX 4070 cap, the components under the hood here aren't top of the range. However, that also means you're not paying top shelf prices.\n" +
      '✅ **You hate fan noise:** No gaming laptop is silent, there will always be that whirr of fans running under the hood. However, the HP Omen Trascend blew us away with how quiet it runs compared to the competition.\n' +
      "Don't buy it if:\n" +
      "❌ **You want an RTX 4080 or RTX 4090:** That 4070 cap is going to frustrate those after a truly stacked machine in a slimline form factor. If you're going to be pushing that QHD+ display to its limits with ultra demanding titles it's worth investing elsewhere.\n" +
      "❌ **You're going to be typing for long periods of time:** It's a strange design quirk, but one that reared its head in our testing. The main keyboard is shifted ever so slightly too far to the left resulting in a slightly unbalanced feel. That's only going to be a deal breaker if you plan on working 8 hours a day in laptop mode, though.\n" +
      "❌ **You're going all in on power:** There are some performance sacrifices made to achieve this skinny design, which means numbers are reduced over a similar Alienware M16, for example. If you're keeping your laptop on your desk and want to invest more in pure performance, this might not be the right fit.\n" +
      "**Design:** A slimline gaming laptop is always going to feel compact, but there's something about the slick matte black aesthetic and cool magnesium-alloy materials that make the Transcend feel all the more svelt. It's a Razer-esque design language that works well, and while it doesn't feel as solid or premium as the real thing, it certainly looks and feels great. It helps that the whole thing weighs in at just 2.1kg - that's one of the lightest gaming laptops running these kinds of components we've had on the test bench.\n" +
      "While we did find the bezels to be a little more pronounced than you'll find on something like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 above, there's still plenty of screen space sitting above an improved hinge.\n" +
      "**Features:** Unlike the Alienware x14, the components available here are going to satisfy the vast majority of players out there. Bumping options up to an RTX 4070 and Intel i9 means only the very top end of the market isn't catered to here. However, if you're looking to spend more you can outfit your rig with a Mini LED 240Hz QHD+ display, up to 32GB DDR5 5600MHz RAM, and 2TB of SSD storage space. Those are some hefty specs, all crammed neatly into the very same ultra portable chassis.\n" +
      "We tested a 1080p job, and even at this lesser used resolution we were impressed with the quality of the display. It's not going to satisfy the cravings of an RTX 4070 GPU, but our 4060 test unit proved that there's still a spot for FHD gameplay in today's generation.\n" +
      "Around the sides, we were also impressed by a generous selection of ports (one of the first things to go in a slimline design). Between two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 options, an RJ45 and a couple of USB-As you're covered for pretty much everything here.\n" +
      "**Performance:** Even with our humble RTX 4060 whirring away under the hood, the HP Omen Transcend managed to put up some excellent numbers. Between 100+ framerates in the majority of our in-game benchmark tests and Time Spy / Fire Strike scores that can battle with the best of them, everything is working particularly well under the hood. The upgraded cooling system works hard to make sure things run smoothly and while temperatures can climb they're never uncomfortable or concerning.\n" +
      "Yes, a larger device is going to draw more out of its components. A like-for-like [Alienware M16](https://www.gamesradar.com/alienware-m16-review/), for example, beat the Omen in dedicated benchmarks and in-game testing (apart from Hitman 3, strangely), but the fact that that performance was only boosted by between 2 and 8% is testament to the Transcend's overall efficiency and design.\n" +
      '> A super slimline chassis housing some of the latest components without fans roaring in the background - HP means business this time around.\n' +
      '>\n' +
      '> HP Omen Transcend 16 review\n' +
      "**Verdict:** We were incredibly impressed with the HP Omen Transcend 16\\. While the brand has struggled to be taken seriously alongside Razer, Alienware and others over the last few years, this could be the start of a new era - and it's definitely the most well-rounded slimline gaming laptop we've tested so far.\n" +
