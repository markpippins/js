# AskJS <img src="https://media.tenor.com/LBFqyVANEtkAAAAi/emm-thinking.gif" alt="Questioning Gif" width="50" height="50">

This repository contains two fun and interactive web projects that showcase basic JavaScript event handling, CSS styling, and HTML structure. Both projects are designed to provide engaging user experiences through dynamic interactions.

## Purpose and Roadmap

The purpose of this project is to provide a new and playful way to engage with your loved ones. If you're looking for a fun way to entertain or surprise someone each month, the project provides a flexible structure where you can easily customize elements like texts, colors, and GIFs directly in the code. For instance, project 2 was created by making small modifications to project 1. In the future, consider adding new versions of this JS project that include ‚ú®a new question each month‚ú® for your special ones.
